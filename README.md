# Tapyn - Flutter App

## Overview
**Tapyn** is a simple yet powerful Flutter application designed to create and manage digital profile cards. With Tapyn, users can convert their profile into a card displaying their links as icons. The app also enables sharing the profile through QR codes, which can be scanned by others to save the profile. Once saved, users can view the profile details and interact with the links.

## Features

1. **Add Links to Your Profile:**
   - Users can add multiple links (e.g., social media, websites, portfolios).
   - These links are displayed as small icons on the profile card.

2. **Profile Cards:**
   - User profiles are converted into cards that visually represent the person’s profile, including their name, designation, and links as icons.
   
3. **QR Code Generation:**
   - Tapping the profile card generates a unique QR code for the user's profile.
   - The QR code contains all the profile information and links.

4. **Save Profiles by Scanning QR Codes:**
   - When another user scans the QR code, the profile card is saved on their phone.
   - The saved card includes the name, designation, and icons for all the added links.

5. **Instant Redirection:**
   - Tapping on any link icon in the saved profile card will instantly redirect users to the respective link (social media, website, etc.).

## How It Works

1. **Create Profile:**
   - Add your name, designation, and any links you want to share.
   - The app automatically generates small icons for these links, which are displayed on your profile card.

2. **Share Your Profile:**
   - Tap your profile card to convert it into a QR code.
   - Share the QR code with others to let them scan and save your profile.

3. **Save & Interact with Profiles:**
   - After scanning a QR code, the profile is saved in the app.
   - Users can view the saved profile and tap the link icons to instantly access the associated platforms.
